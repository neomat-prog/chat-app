# Chat App 👥

Simple Live chat application using Python, Flask & SocketIO. 
This is my first bigger project that I have made by myself. It is a bare bone structure, but a working one.


## 🤖 Deployment 

To deploy this project, in the folder where the files are located run the following command in any terminal:

```bash
  python main.py
```

The output will consist of many elements by which you shall use the link with the address of the application

for example:

```bash
Right click or CTRL-C the link to enter the application ❗

  https://127.0.0.0.000
```
